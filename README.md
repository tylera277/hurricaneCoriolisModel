# hurricaneCoriolisModel

A super raw/unfinished program which has the goal of modeling a hurricanes trajectory if it was solely under the influence of the coriolis force and comparing that to the actual path that it takes, and to compare these in order to see qualitatively the degree in which a hurricane's path is influenced solely by the Coriolis force. 
The picture below showing yellow markers which are the predicted path, red being a few spots of a hurricane, in this case hurricane florence, and purple being a line with a constant latitude in order to be able to better see the curvature in the other two.

Note: This program is really shitty and I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with the challenge of it at the moment. My model feels very fine tuned as I cant get a hurricane going towards the east in the southern hemisphere and when I try to change the velocities, it isn't as flexible as I would wish it to be, as reversing the velocities has no effect on the chart it produces. Still needs work.
